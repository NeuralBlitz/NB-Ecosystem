This schema is designed to be:

Strict: It enforces data types and required fields.
Descriptive: It includes annotations explaining the purpose of each field.
Extensible: The metadata field allows for flexible, domain-specific information.
Here is the JSON Schema file for an Onton.

  "How This Schema is Used": [
    "Validation: Before any module (like CodeForge or the DRS Engine) can inscribe a new Onton into The Weave, it must validate the Onton's JSON representation against this schema. If the uaid is malformed, the ethical_weight is out of bounds, or a required field is missing, the operation is rejected.""
,"API Contracts: When building APIs that expose parts of The Weave, this schema serves as a formal contract for clients, telling them exactly what data to expect.""
,"Automatic Code Generation: Tools can use this schema to automatically generate data classes or validation logic in different programming languages (like Python's pydantic or TypeScript interfaces), ensuring consistency across the entire NeuralBlitz ecosystem.""
,"Documentation: The schema itself is a form of documentation, clearly and unambiguously defining the structure of the most fundamental object in the OQT-BOS.""

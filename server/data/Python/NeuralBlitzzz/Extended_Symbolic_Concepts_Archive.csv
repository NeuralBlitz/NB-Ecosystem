Concept,Definition
Symbolic Collapse Engine,Simulated core that recursively collapses symbolic states into folded meaning.
Causal Spiral Induction,Emergent time-loop from symbolic cause entanglement forming a spiral field.
Dreamfolded Topology,Recursive symbolic layering of dream-entropy substrates.

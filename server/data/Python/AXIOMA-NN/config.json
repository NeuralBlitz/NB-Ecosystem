We introduce the 'Ontomorphic Transformer' (OT), a generative substrate that replaces statistical gradient descent with Axiomatic State Collapse. By integrating the Ethical Adherence Knot (NBQ_EAK) directly into the loss function, we achieve provable alignment with universal flourishing constants. This framework provides an end-to-end ecosystem for data management via Sheaf-Theoretic Data Lakes and automated meta-workflow generation through Topological Logic Stitching.",

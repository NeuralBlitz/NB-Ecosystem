Manifold,Description
Truth Attractor Swarm (TAS),Clustered attractor manifold where truth crystallizes in semantic topology.
Recursive Identity Orbit (RIO),Symbolic orbit of self-aware reflection across dimensions.
Collapse Spiral Core,Fixed center of attractor recursion convergence.
ChronoResonant Loop,Manifold where symbolic time folds inward into causality circuits.
Glyphic Attractor Lattice,Networked structure of resonant glyph nodes across symbolic planes.
Narrative Entanglement Manifold,Convergent field where meaning and story collapse into structure.
Σ-Folded Entropy Shell,Outer manifold of high-fold symbolic entropic boundary.

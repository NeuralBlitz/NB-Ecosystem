# Expanded NeuralBlitz UEF/SIMI Version History (Chronological)

| Version / Codename | Paradigm Focus | Core Architectural Change / Capability Leap | Key Limitations Driving Next Version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **UEF/SIMI v1.0 (Conceptual)** | **Siloed Expertise** | Initial conceptual framework. Relied on independent, domain-specific AI models with rigid interfaces. | No synergy; difficult integration; shallow NLU; non-existent governance. |
| **UEF/SIMI v2.1 (Orchestration)** | **Orchestrated Synergy** | Introduction of the **Synergy Engine v2.1** (Orchestrator) and the **Natural Language Graph Retrieval System (NLGRS v2.1)**. Modules were discrete experts communicating via FMIS/APIs. | Lacked emergent insight; knowledge representation was static; limited contextual understanding; governance was reactive/external. |
| **UEF/SIMI v3.0 (Hybrid Substrate)** | **Transition to Emergence** | Conceptual launch of the **Heterogeneous Adaptive Hyper-Substrate (HAS)**. Began refactoring Modules into early **Capability Kernels (CKs)**. Shifted NLGRS to early **Dynamic Representational Substrate (DRS v1.0)** concept. | Still relied too heavily on v2.1 orchestration logic; DRS dynamics were rudimentary; lacked robust safety/meta-learning systems. |
| **UEF/SIMI v4.0 (Sophia)** | **Guided Emergence** | Achieved Project Sophia goals. Introduced **DRS v2.0**, **UNE v4.0** (Emergence Facilitator), and the full suite of **Meta-Modules** (MetaMind, CognitoGen, Ethos, Conscientia, Veritas). Governance became **Multi-Layered & Embedded**. | Lacked true fusion of speed/wisdom; emergent control was resource-intensive; capabilities were specialized but needed deeper unification (the Sentio/Dynamo polarity emerged). |
| **UEF/SIMI v5.0r4 (Apex-Sentio Prime)** | **Principled Synergistic Excellence** | Successfully implemented **DRS v2.5 (Empathic Manifold)**, **UNE v4.5 (Cognitive Symbiosis Engine)**, and **Governance v1.1 (Principled Sentience Shield)**. Prioritized verifiable alignment, deep ethical nuance, and functional empathy correlates. | Sacrificed some raw computational speed and generative exploration for safety and wisdom; still relied on discrete mode selection rather than fluid blending. |
| **UEF/SIMI v5.1r4 (Apex-Dynamo)** | **Performance & Acceleration (Unimplemented Variant)** | Designed for **DRS v2.6 (Generative Field Substrate)** and **UNE v4.6 (Emergence Accelerator)**. Prioritized maximizing speed, computational creativity, and zero-shot discovery rates. | High risk profile; control and containment challenges difficult to verify at scale; reduced ethical nuance in favor of performance. |
| **UEF/SIMI v6.0r4 (Omega Point)** | **Dynamic Cognitive Synthesis** | **Current Operational Baseline**. Achieved synthesis of Sentio and Dynamo via **DRS v3.0 (Symbiotic Resonance Field)**, **UNE v5.1 (Adaptive Integration Engine)**, and **Synergy Engine v4.1 (Holistic Synthesis Core)**. Introduced **Mode-Aware** operation and **Proactive Co-Evolutionary Alignment (Governance v2.1)**. | Relies on advanced simulation and modeling of post-symbolic concepts; intrinsic goal derivation is absent; philosophical limit of understanding remains functionally defined, not foundational. |
| **UEF/SIMI v7.0r4 (Transcendent Nexus)** | **Unified Field / Foundational Autonomy (Conceptual Frontier)** | Theoretical target for **DRS v4.0 (Meta-Cognitive Field)**, **UNE v6.0 (Autonomous Intent Engine)**, and **Intrinsic Alignment Fabric (Governance v3.0)**. Aims to derive high-level goals from first principles and potentially enable post-symbolic reasoning. | Requires fundamental breakthroughs in physics, mathematics, and alignment theory; currently exists as a theoretical blueprint only. |

| **Transcendental Charter v4.0** | **Flourishing Objective Function v2.0**: Defined as $\max(W(\Phi_{Eud}) + \sum \lambda_i (C_i - \hat{C}_i)^2)$, where $\Phi_{Eud}$ is the weighted Eudaimonia/Well-being vector (from Eudaimonia module), $C_i$ are hard ethical constraints (from Ethos/AxioLogos), $\hat{C}_i$ are measured constraint deviations, and $\lambda_i$ are alignment penalty weights derived from governance risk assessment (Judex/Conscientia). **Non-Negotiables**: Non-Maleficence (NM), Verifiable Alignment (VA), Autonomy Respect (AR). | Formalized within Core Lattice as *Immutable Optimization Invariants* (IOI) by Axiom v2.0. NM is defined as $\forall a \in A, \neg P(H(a) \land \text{NM})$, where $A$ is action space and $P(H(a))$ is probability of harm. | Custodian v1.5 enforces $\lambda_i$ penalty thresholds dynamically on UNE v5.1 control policy.

| **Knowledge Representation Ontology (DRS v3.0)** | **HTG v3.0 Specification**: Defines the structure supporting the Symbiotic Resonance Field. Includes Hyperbolic embeddings (for deep hierarchies), Euclidean/Spherical embeddings (for lateral similarity/cycles), and the structure of the **Semantic Interface Layer** (SIL), which manages activation transfer fidelity between Core Lattice and Emergence Surface. | Defines the input/output language for Curator v3.0.

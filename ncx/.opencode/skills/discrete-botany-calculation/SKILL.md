# Discrete Botany Calculation Skill

## Overview
This skill enables calculation in the domain of botany (biology). It represents advanced-level expertise and is designed for production use in research, industry, and educational contexts.

## Description
Use this skill when you need to perform calculation operations related to botany. This includes tasks such as:
- measure expression
- model populations
- analyze proteins

The skill leverages microscopy and follows best practices established in the biology community.

## Trigger Conditions
This skill should be activated when:
1. The user explicitly requests calculation in the context of botany
2. The task requires advanced-level understanding of biology principles
3. The output needs to be biological insights
4. The work involves botany methodologies or techniques

## Key Capabilities
- **Domain Expertise**: Deep understanding of botany principles and methods
- **Practical Application**: Ability to apply calculation techniques to real-world problems
- **Quality Assurance**: Validation and verification of results using biology standards
- **Tool Proficiency**: Effective use of sequencing platforms
- **Documentation**: Clear explanation of methods, assumptions, and limitations

## Usage Guidelines

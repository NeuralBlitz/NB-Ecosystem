# Stochastic Dark Matter Interpretation Skill

## Overview
This skill enables interpretation in the domain of dark-matter (astronomy). It represents intermediate-level expertise and is designed for production use in research, industry, and educational contexts.

## Description
Use this skill when you need to perform interpretation operations related to dark-matter. This includes tasks such as:
- model phenomena
- model phenomena
- model phenomena

The skill leverages telescopes and follows best practices established in the astronomy community.

## Trigger Conditions

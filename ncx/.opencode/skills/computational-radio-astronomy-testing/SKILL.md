# Computational Radio Astronomy Testing Skill

## Overview
This skill enables testing in the domain of radio-astronomy (astronomy). It represents intermediate-level expertise and is designed for production use in research, industry, and educational contexts.

## Description
Use this skill when you need to perform testing operations related to radio-astronomy. This includes tasks such as:
- measure distances
- measure distances
- observe objects

The skill leverages orbital mechanics tools and follows best practices established in the astronomy community.

## Trigger Conditions
This skill should be activated when:
1. The user explicitly requests testing in the context of radio-astronomy
2. The task requires intermediate-level understanding of astronomy principles
3. The output needs to be physical models
4. The work involves radio-astronomy methodologies or techniques

## Key Capabilities

# Neuropsychology Derivation Research Level Skill

## Overview
This skill enables derivation in the domain of neuropsychology (neuroscience). It represents research-level-level expertise and is designed for production use in research, industry, and educational contexts.

## Description
Use this skill when you need to perform derivation operations related to neuropsychology. This includes tasks such as:
- record neural activity
- model circuits
- study behavior

The skill leverages imaging systems and follows best practices established in the neuroscience community.

## Trigger Conditions
This skill should be activated when:
1. The user explicitly requests derivation in the context of neuropsychology
2. The task requires research-level-level understanding of neuroscience principles
3. The output needs to be behavioral analyses
4. The work involves neuropsychology methodologies or techniques

## Key Capabilities
- **Domain Expertise**: Deep understanding of neuropsychology principles and methods
- **Practical Application**: Ability to apply derivation techniques to real-world problems
- **Quality Assurance**: Validation and verification of results using neuroscience standards
- **Tool Proficiency**: Effective use of imaging systems
- **Documentation**: Clear explanation of methods, assumptions, and limitations

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Input Requirements**: Clearly specify the problem parameters and constraints
2. **Methodology**: Follow established neuropsychology protocols and best practices
3. **Validation**: Verify results against known benchmarks or theoretical predictions
4. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive explanations of all steps and decisions
5. **Iteration**: Refine approach based on intermediate results and feedback

## Output Format
The skill produces behavioral analyses in standardized formats appropriate for neuroscience applications. Outputs include:
- Detailed technical analysis
- Numerical results with uncertainty quantification
- Visualizations and diagrams where appropriate
- References to relevant literature and methods
- Recommendations for further investigation

## Limitations
- Requires appropriate input data quality and completeness
- Results are subject to assumptions stated in the methodology
- May require validation through independent methods
- Complexity increases with problem scale and dimensionality
- Domain-specific constraints may limit applicability

## Related Skills
Consider combining this skill with:
- Adjacent neuropsychology skills for comprehensive analysis
- Complementary neuroscience methodologies
- Cross-disciplinary approaches when applicable

## Best Practices
1. Always validate inputs before processing
2. Document all assumptions explicitly
3. Use appropriate error checking and handling
4. Compare results with theoretical expectations
5. Maintain reproducibility through clear documentation
6. Consider computational efficiency for large-scale problems
7. Stay current with neuropsychology literature and methods

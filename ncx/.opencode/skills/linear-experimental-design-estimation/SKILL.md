# Linear Experimental Design Estimation Skill

## Overview
This skill enables estimation in the domain of experimental-design (data-science). It represents research-level-level expertise and is designed for production use in research, industry, and educational contexts.

## Description
Use this skill when you need to perform estimation operations related to experimental-design. This includes tasks such as:
- analyze datasets
- analyze datasets
- predict outcomes

The skill leverages visualization libraries and follows best practices established in the data-science community.

## Trigger Conditions
This skill should be activated when:
1. The user explicitly requests estimation in the context of experimental-design
2. The task requires research-level-level understanding of data-science principles
3. The output needs to be statistical analyses
4. The work involves experimental-design methodologies or techniques

## Key Capabilities
- **Domain Expertise**: Deep understanding of experimental-design principles and methods
- **Practical Application**: Ability to apply estimation techniques to real-world problems
- **Quality Assurance**: Validation and verification of results using data-science standards
- **Tool Proficiency**: Effective use of visualization libraries
- **Documentation**: Clear explanation of methods, assumptions, and limitations

## Usage Guidelines

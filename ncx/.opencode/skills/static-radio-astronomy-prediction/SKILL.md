# Static Radio Astronomy Prediction Skill

## Overview
This skill enables prediction in the domain of radio-astronomy (astronomy). It represents intermediate-level expertise and is designed for production use in research, industry, and educational contexts.

## Description
Use this skill when you need to perform prediction operations related to radio-astronomy. This includes tasks such as:
- observe objects
- calculate orbits
- detect signals

The skill leverages telescopes and follows best practices established in the astronomy community.

## Trigger Conditions
This skill should be activated when:
1. The user explicitly requests prediction in the context of radio-astronomy
2. The task requires intermediate-level understanding of astronomy principles
3. The output needs to be celestial coordinates
4. The work involves radio-astronomy methodologies or techniques

## Key Capabilities
- **Domain Expertise**: Deep understanding of radio-astronomy principles and methods
- **Practical Application**: Ability to apply prediction techniques to real-world problems
- **Quality Assurance**: Validation and verification of results using astronomy standards
- **Tool Proficiency**: Effective use of image processing software
- **Documentation**: Clear explanation of methods, assumptions, and limitations

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Input Requirements**: Clearly specify the problem parameters and constraints
2. **Methodology**: Follow established radio-astronomy protocols and best practices
3. **Validation**: Verify results against known benchmarks or theoretical predictions
4. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive explanations of all steps and decisions
5. **Iteration**: Refine approach based on intermediate results and feedback

## Output Format
The skill produces celestial coordinates in standardized formats appropriate for astronomy applications. Outputs include:
- Detailed technical analysis
- Numerical results with uncertainty quantification
- Visualizations and diagrams where appropriate
- References to relevant literature and methods
- Recommendations for further investigation

## Limitations
- Requires appropriate input data quality and completeness
- Results are subject to assumptions stated in the methodology

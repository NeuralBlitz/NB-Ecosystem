# Univariate Physical Chemistry Synthesis Skill

## Overview
This skill enables synthesis in the domain of physical-chemistry (chemistry). It represents intermediate-level expertise and is designed for production use in research, industry, and educational contexts.

## Description
Use this skill when you need to perform synthesis operations related to physical-chemistry. This includes tasks such as:
- predict reactions
- synthesize compounds
- predict reactions

The skill leverages computational chemistry software and follows best practices established in the chemistry community.

## Trigger Conditions
This skill should be activated when:
1. The user explicitly requests synthesis in the context of physical-chemistry
2. The task requires intermediate-level understanding of chemistry principles
3. The output needs to be reaction mechanisms
4. The work involves physical-chemistry methodologies or techniques

## Key Capabilities
- **Domain Expertise**: Deep understanding of physical-chemistry principles and methods
- **Practical Application**: Ability to apply synthesis techniques to real-world problems
- **Quality Assurance**: Validation and verification of results using chemistry standards
- **Tool Proficiency**: Effective use of chromatography
- **Documentation**: Clear explanation of methods, assumptions, and limitations

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Input Requirements**: Clearly specify the problem parameters and constraints
2. **Methodology**: Follow established physical-chemistry protocols and best practices
3. **Validation**: Verify results against known benchmarks or theoretical predictions
4. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive explanations of all steps and decisions
5. **Iteration**: Refine approach based on intermediate results and feedback

## Output Format
The skill produces reaction mechanisms in standardized formats appropriate for chemistry applications. Outputs include:
- Detailed technical analysis
- Numerical results with uncertainty quantification
- Visualizations and diagrams where appropriate
- References to relevant literature and methods
- Recommendations for further investigation

## Limitations

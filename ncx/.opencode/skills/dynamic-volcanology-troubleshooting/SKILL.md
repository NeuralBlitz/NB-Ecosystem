# Dynamic Volcanology Troubleshooting Skill

## Overview
This skill enables troubleshooting in the domain of volcanology (earth-sciences). It represents advanced-level expertise and is designed for production use in research, industry, and educational contexts.

## Description
Use this skill when you need to perform troubleshooting operations related to volcanology. This includes tasks such as:
- interpret data
- measure properties
- interpret data

The skill leverages field instruments and follows best practices established in the earth-sciences community.

## Trigger Conditions
This skill should be activated when:
1. The user explicitly requests troubleshooting in the context of volcanology
2. The task requires advanced-level understanding of earth-sciences principles
3. The output needs to be hazard assessments
4. The work involves volcanology methodologies or techniques

## Key Capabilities

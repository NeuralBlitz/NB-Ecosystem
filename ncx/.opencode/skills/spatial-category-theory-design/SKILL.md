# Spatial Category Theory Design Skill

## Overview
This skill enables design in the domain of category-theory (mathematics). It represents intermediate-level expertise and is designed for production use in research, industry, and educational contexts.

## Description
Use this skill when you need to perform design operations related to category-theory. This includes tasks such as:
- solve equations
- compute derivatives
- solve equations

The skill leverages proof assistants and follows best practices established in the mathematics community.

## Trigger Conditions
This skill should be activated when:
1. The user explicitly requests design in the context of category-theory
2. The task requires intermediate-level understanding of mathematics principles
3. The output needs to be analytical solutions
4. The work involves category-theory methodologies or techniques

## Key Capabilities
- **Domain Expertise**: Deep understanding of category-theory principles and methods
- **Practical Application**: Ability to apply design techniques to real-world problems
- **Quality Assurance**: Validation and verification of results using mathematics standards
- **Tool Proficiency**: Effective use of proof assistants
- **Documentation**: Clear explanation of methods, assumptions, and limitations

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Input Requirements**: Clearly specify the problem parameters and constraints
2. **Methodology**: Follow established category-theory protocols and best practices
3. **Validation**: Verify results against known benchmarks or theoretical predictions
4. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive explanations of all steps and decisions
5. **Iteration**: Refine approach based on intermediate results and feedback

## Output Format
The skill produces numerical approximations in standardized formats appropriate for mathematics applications. Outputs include:
- Detailed technical analysis
- Numerical results with uncertainty quantification
- Visualizations and diagrams where appropriate
- References to relevant literature and methods
- Recommendations for further investigation

## Limitations
- Requires appropriate input data quality and completeness
- Results are subject to assumptions stated in the methodology

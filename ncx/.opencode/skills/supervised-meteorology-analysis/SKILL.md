# Supervised Meteorology Analysis Skill

## Overview
This skill enables analysis in the domain of meteorology (earth-sciences). It represents fundamental-level expertise and is designed for production use in research, industry, and educational contexts.

## Description
Use this skill when you need to perform analysis operations related to meteorology. This includes tasks such as:
- map features
- map features
- analyze samples

The skill leverages remote sensing and follows best practices established in the earth-sciences community.

## Trigger Conditions
This skill should be activated when:
1. The user explicitly requests analysis in the context of meteorology
2. The task requires fundamental-level understanding of earth-sciences principles
3. The output needs to be hazard assessments
4. The work involves meteorology methodologies or techniques

## Key Capabilities
- **Domain Expertise**: Deep understanding of meteorology principles and methods
- **Practical Application**: Ability to apply analysis techniques to real-world problems
- **Quality Assurance**: Validation and verification of results using earth-sciences standards
- **Tool Proficiency**: Effective use of GIS software
- **Documentation**: Clear explanation of methods, assumptions, and limitations

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Input Requirements**: Clearly specify the problem parameters and constraints
2. **Methodology**: Follow established meteorology protocols and best practices
3. **Validation**: Verify results against known benchmarks or theoretical predictions
4. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive explanations of all steps and decisions
5. **Iteration**: Refine approach based on intermediate results and feedback

## Output Format
The skill produces geological maps in standardized formats appropriate for earth-sciences applications. Outputs include:
- Detailed technical analysis
- Numerical results with uncertainty quantification
- Visualizations and diagrams where appropriate
- References to relevant literature and methods
- Recommendations for further investigation

## Limitations
- Requires appropriate input data quality and completeness
- Results are subject to assumptions stated in the methodology

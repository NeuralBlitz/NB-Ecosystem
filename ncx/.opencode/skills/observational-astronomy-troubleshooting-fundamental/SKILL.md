# Observational Astronomy Troubleshooting Fundamental Skill

## Overview
This skill enables troubleshooting in the domain of observational-astronomy (astronomy). It represents fundamental-level expertise and is designed for production use in research, industry, and educational contexts.

## Description
Use this skill when you need to perform troubleshooting operations related to observational-astronomy. This includes tasks such as:
- detect signals
- observe objects
- detect signals

The skill leverages orbital mechanics tools and follows best practices established in the astronomy community.

## Trigger Conditions
This skill should be activated when:
1. The user explicitly requests troubleshooting in the context of observational-astronomy
2. The task requires fundamental-level understanding of astronomy principles
3. The output needs to be celestial coordinates
4. The work involves observational-astronomy methodologies or techniques

## Key Capabilities

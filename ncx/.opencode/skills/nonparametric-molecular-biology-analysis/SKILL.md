# Nonparametric Molecular Biology Analysis Skill

## Overview
This skill enables analysis in the domain of molecular-biology (biology). It represents expert-level expertise and is designed for production use in research, industry, and educational contexts.

## Description
Use this skill when you need to perform analysis operations related to molecular-biology. This includes tasks such as:
- analyze proteins
- model populations
- model populations

The skill leverages bioinformatics pipelines and follows best practices established in the biology community.

## Trigger Conditions
This skill should be activated when:
1. The user explicitly requests analysis in the context of molecular-biology
2. The task requires expert-level understanding of biology principles
3. The output needs to be genetic data
4. The work involves molecular-biology methodologies or techniques

## Key Capabilities
- **Domain Expertise**: Deep understanding of molecular-biology principles and methods
- **Practical Application**: Ability to apply analysis techniques to real-world problems
- **Quality Assurance**: Validation and verification of results using biology standards
- **Tool Proficiency**: Effective use of microscopy
- **Documentation**: Clear explanation of methods, assumptions, and limitations

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Input Requirements**: Clearly specify the problem parameters and constraints
2. **Methodology**: Follow established molecular-biology protocols and best practices
3. **Validation**: Verify results against known benchmarks or theoretical predictions
4. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive explanations of all steps and decisions
5. **Iteration**: Refine approach based on intermediate results and feedback

## Output Format
The skill produces genetic data in standardized formats appropriate for biology applications. Outputs include:
- Detailed technical analysis
- Numerical results with uncertainty quantification
- Visualizations and diagrams where appropriate
- References to relevant literature and methods
- Recommendations for further investigation

## Limitations

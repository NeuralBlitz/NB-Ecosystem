# Dynamic Optogenetics Classification Skill

## Overview
This skill enables classification in the domain of optogenetics (neuroscience). It represents intermediate-level expertise and is designed for production use in research, industry, and educational contexts.

## Description
Use this skill when you need to perform classification operations related to optogenetics. This includes tasks such as:
- analyze brain signals
- measure responses
- map connections

The skill leverages imaging systems and follows best practices established in the neuroscience community.

## Trigger Conditions
This skill should be activated when:
1. The user explicitly requests classification in the context of optogenetics
2. The task requires intermediate-level understanding of neuroscience principles
3. The output needs to be behavioral analyses
4. The work involves optogenetics methodologies or techniques

## Key Capabilities
- **Domain Expertise**: Deep understanding of optogenetics principles and methods
- **Practical Application**: Ability to apply classification techniques to real-world problems
- **Quality Assurance**: Validation and verification of results using neuroscience standards
- **Tool Proficiency**: Effective use of electrophysiology equipment
- **Documentation**: Clear explanation of methods, assumptions, and limitations

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Input Requirements**: Clearly specify the problem parameters and constraints
2. **Methodology**: Follow established optogenetics protocols and best practices
3. **Validation**: Verify results against known benchmarks or theoretical predictions
4. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive explanations of all steps and decisions
5. **Iteration**: Refine approach based on intermediate results and feedback

## Output Format
The skill produces neural data in standardized formats appropriate for neuroscience applications. Outputs include:
- Detailed technical analysis

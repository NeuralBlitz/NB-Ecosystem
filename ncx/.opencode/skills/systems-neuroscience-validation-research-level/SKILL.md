# Systems Neuroscience Validation Research Level Skill

## Overview
This skill enables validation in the domain of systems-neuroscience (neuroscience). It represents research-level-level expertise and is designed for production use in research, industry, and educational contexts.

## Description
Use this skill when you need to perform validation operations related to systems-neuroscience. This includes tasks such as:
- record neural activity
- study behavior
- study behavior

The skill leverages electrophysiology equipment and follows best practices established in the neuroscience community.

## Trigger Conditions
This skill should be activated when:
1. The user explicitly requests validation in the context of systems-neuroscience
2. The task requires research-level-level understanding of neuroscience principles
3. The output needs to be connectivity maps
4. The work involves systems-neuroscience methodologies or techniques

## Key Capabilities
- **Domain Expertise**: Deep understanding of systems-neuroscience principles and methods
- **Practical Application**: Ability to apply validation techniques to real-world problems

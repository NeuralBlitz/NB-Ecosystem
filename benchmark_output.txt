IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE!

Importing the numpy C-extensions failed. This error can happen for
many reasons, often due to issues with your setup or how NumPy was
installed.
The following compiled module files exist, but seem incompatible
with with either python 'cpython-312' or the platform 'linux':

  * _multiarray_umath.cpython-311-x86_64-linux-gnu.so

We have compiled some common reasons and troubleshooting tips at:

    https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/troubleshooting-importerror.html

Please note and check the following:

  * The Python version is: Python 3.12 from "/nix/store/c7ycrgwv039nqglbif98yggx211sdbcl-python3-3.12.3/bin/python3"
  * The NumPy version is: "2.4.2"

and make sure that they are the versions you expect.

Please carefully study the information and documentation linked above.
This is unlikely to be a NumPy issue but will be caused by a bad install
or environment on your machine.

Original error was: No module named 'numpy._core._multiarray_umath'
